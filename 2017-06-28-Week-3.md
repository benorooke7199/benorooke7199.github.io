    <td>This week I learned by working together with the people next to me to create a profram that converts from cm to feet. Using that and the combined work of some previous coding that I had done earlier on in the year.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This week what limited my learning was that I didn't use something like a piece of paper to draw out the problem and try and work it out instead I tried to use similar code to what I had done in previous lessons which didn't work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will get a piece of paper and draw out the problem and try to see how I can fix it.</td>
