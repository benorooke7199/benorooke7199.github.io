  <tr>
    <td>This week I learnt by looking at what the teacher had on the board and not directly copying it but taking the same idea and using it with different code. I also learnt by using paper to try and work out how to get round the problem.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning this week was that I needed to try more trial and error because I did things that didn't work and I wasn't sure why so I needed to find away around that.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time when I am stuck I will try trial and error and or possibly work with the person next to me so i can develop my understanding from someone else's perspective.</td>
